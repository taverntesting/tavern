# Tavern API Testing

If you haven't already, it's worth looking through the [examples](/examples.md)
before diving into this.

Note that Tavern **only** supports Python 2.7/3.4 and up. At the time of writing we
test against Python 2.7/3.4-3.7 and pypy/pypy3. Using Python 3 is strongly
advised over using Python 2, and support for Python 2 is likely to be dropped in
future.
